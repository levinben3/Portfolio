## Data Analysis Projects
This includes different Matlab and Simulink-based projects aimed at using .csv or .mat data files to better understand the vehicle. Our normal process is to convert MoTec data into the correctly formatted csv through python data frames before using them within the Matlab/Simulink environment. 

Any .pdf's of the same name as a .slx Simulink file are visualizations of the simulation for ease of understanding without opening in Simulink.
