## Simulations Projects
All vehicle simulations work is housed in this directory. Throughout the year, we conduct simulations to help with battery sizing, inverter PID tuning, controls testing, tire modeling, and more. This is a vital and ever-expanding part of the software position at Columbia FSAE. 

Any .pdf's of the same name as a .slx Simulink file are visualizations of the simulation for ease of understanding without opening in Simulink.
