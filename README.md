<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Benjamin! üëã</h1>

> Hi, I am an undergraduate student at Columbia University in the City of New York. As a physics major, I am both passionate about the most cutting-edge projects in different disciplines, such as high energy astrophysics, and applied software engineering projects that use my physics background. 

I am also the current software lead for Columbia's Formula SAE Electric team, leading controls, firmware, design, simulations, and other data analysis projects. With an extensive math, physics, and statistical analysis background, I have been able to take a more analytical approach to Columbia FSAE's software team, allowing for more grounded decisions and innovative projects.

I am interested in continuing to apply these diverse skills to related integrated firmware and applied software fields.

### Sections

| Project Name             | Contents                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FSAE Data Analysis | Different FSAE projects focused on taking data captured using MoTec and i2 systems and processing it in different models to gain a better understanding of the vehicle, such as sensor noise, car moment, mass, coast down curves, and more. |
| High Energy Astrophysics | All work related to high energy astrophysics, mainly focused on developing a grouping pipeline to analyze the energy spectrum of galactic center energetic point sources. This pipeline involves wget scripts, statistical grouping, contour mapping, and more.  |
| Low Voltage Systems | High level low voltage code written for the Columbia FSAE vehicle, combining all low voltage systems such as controls systems, sensors, and the vehicle state machine. |
| Simulations | A variety of simulations and models developed to analyze important parts of the vehicle, such as point mass, power train, and motor simulations. |
| Traction Control | A core Columbia FSAE controls project to develop straightline and curve feed-forward traction control to improve the team's score, time, and drivability. |
