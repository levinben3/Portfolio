> Hi, I am an undergraduate student at Columbia University in the City of New York. As a physics major, I am both passionate about the most cutting-edge projects in different disciplines, such as high energy astrophysics. I am also the current software lead for Columbia's Formula SAE Electric team, leading controls, firmware, design, simulations, and other data analysis projects. With an extensive math, physics, and statistical analysis background, I have been able to take a more analytical approach to Columbia FSAE's software team, allowing for more grounded decisions and innovative projects. I am interested in continuing to apply these diverse skills to related integrated firmware and applied software fields.
